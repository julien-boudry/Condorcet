CHANGELOG
=========
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v2.1.0] - 2019-11-29
### Description
Move to PHP 7.4 version.

### Changed
- PHP 7.4 is the new minimal PHP version required.

### Internal changes
- Use PHP 7.4 new types on property. For security and performances reasons.

## [v2.0.0] - 2019-09-07
### Description
Small but many API changes (renaming, rationalization), sometimes on main methods. Very important internal optimizations. Also use a new namespace!

### Added
- Very significant efforts about the documentation. Still in progress.
- Add two distincts methods Election::getCondorcetWinner() & Election::getCondorcetLoser(). the result are strictly equivalent to Election::getWinner(null) & Election::getWinner(null) but it's more explicit. And it is consistent with the homonymous methods of the result object.

### Changed
- Use new vendor namespace \CondorcetPHP instead \Condorcet because we don't have the Github Condorcet ID for this last one. The new base namespace is \CondorcetPHP\Condorcet\
- Adding votes or candidates from Json or string parsing, will not check if all of them are valid. And only if all are valid, then they are registered. Previously, an exception was sent to the first error, but the status remained partially recorded.
- Many methods have been renamed or divided for greater consistency and intelligibility. Some parameters may have changed or used more strict type. 
- CondorcertException class moves to a new namespace Throwable\CondorcetException. Condorcet can now also throw Trowable\CondorcetInternalError error.
- Some change on "Schulze Ratio" method computation, can affect the result of some type of election. It's still imperfect due to a case that the theory doesn't take into account. However, very small or very typical elections will have more logical results. The more common Winning & Margin methods are not affected.
- Many other various fixes.
- New Condorcet logo.

### Removed
- Removes the slightly twisted method Election::ignoreMaxVote

### Performance
- Adding, changing or removing vote after requesting firsts Result, will prevent recomputing all the pairwise and prefer to update it. Can be a small optimization for most use case, or a very huge performances improvements if you manage a very large number of votes or use an external data handler for storing them.
- Parse Vote (text or Json) is really faster, save huge memory consumption on big input if you use the if use the multiplication symbol for equal votes. And memory is now predictable, linear and as smart as other input vote methods.
- Overall, significant savings in memory usage.
- Many other performance optimizations.

### Internal changes
- Voting Method extending PairwiseStatsBased_Core must use static constant COUNT_TYPE instead of $\_countType property.
- Add many tests.
- Add benchmarks with phpbench.

## [v1.8.2] - 2019-02-16
### Description
Allow development environment for PHP 7.4.

### Changed
- Use PHP UNIT 8.x (compatible up to PHP 7.4) for PHP version >= 7.2.
- Compatibility with PHP Unit 8.x serie

## [v1.8.1] - 2019-01-05
### Description
Tests for PHP 7.3 and prevent PHP >=7.4 deprecations.

### Added
- Tests for PHP 7.3
- Prevent PHP 7.4 deprecations.

## [v1.8.0] - 2018-07-22
### Description
You can add custom constraint to force votes to meet certain criteria.   
Constraint are designed as free modules (external class to load into each election). A first module is officially proposed (disabled by default): Preventing votes from including ties.

### Added
- Vote constraints functionality
- First official vote constraint module: Disallow vote tie on any rank in election context.
- Tested with PHP 7.3.
- Always better code!

## [v1.7.0] - 2018-05-26
### Description
Adds for the first time methods unrelated to Condorcet's criteria (Borda, Alternative Voting, FTPT).

### Added
- New voting method: Borda Count
- New voting method: Dowdall System (Nauru), a Borda Count variant.
- New voting method: Instant-runoff (also know as Alternative Voting or Preferential Voting)
- New voting method: First-past-the-post

### Changed
- Result object (iterator and his others methods) is now ordered by key  from first rank to last rank. However, no method officially implemented before version 1.7 was affected by this theoretical problem. This never affected the correct rank allocation, but could cause misinterpretation if carelessly repeated in a loop.

### Internal changes
- Code cleanup & test improvements

## [v1.6.0] - 2018-01-28
### Description
Publication centred on two axes:  
Firstly, the improvement and finishing of the internal structure, often for the purpose of readability of the code and good practices. And an extension of the tests.  
The second part concerns the continued improvement of the management of the very large elections.

### Added
- Add \CondorcetPHP\Election::getVotesListGenerator and \CondorcetPHP\DataManager\VotesManager::getVotesListGenerator methods. Same as getVotesList method, but output a PHP generator instead of full array. Useful only for working on vera large election with an external DataHandler.

### Changed
- \CondorcetPHP\Condorcet::format() method move to \CondorcetPHP\CondorcetUtil::format()
- \CondorcetPHP\CondorcetUtil::format() can no longer optionally produce a var_dump(). You must do it yourself.
- Remove \CondorcetPHP\Election::getVoteByKey() method
- Fix \CondorcetPHP\Election cloning issues
- Simply DataHandlerDriverInterface
- Optimize \CondorcetPHP\Election::countVotes and \CondorcetPHP\DataManager\VotesManager::countVotes methods performance and memory usage in case of using an external DataHandler.

### Internal changes
- Cut out some classes and functions into smaller sub-groups.
- New dev tools in new dedicated folder (update documentation, generate Kemenyâ€“Young cache)
- Documentation generator code move to a new repository
- Git force Unix style line-ending (This could cause unexpected behavior in some tests related to the export of votes in string output.)
- Various optimizations & bugfix
- Test coverage up to 95%
- Wonderful new files headers

## [v1.5.0] - 2018-01-08
### Description
This release focuses on the management of very large elections.
It more rigorously reviews the functioning of the DataHandler, which is an advanced way to manage a very large number of votes, which is more stable, mature and tested.
It adds, as an alternative and as a complement (both can be used in consort) the notion of the weight of a vote. This may be useful for elections in which voters are not equal. Or to emulate a big election (without too many possible combinations!) if you don't need to store the details of each vote at Condorcet level.

### Added
- It is now possible to add a weight (integer >= 1) to each vote. If you enable this mode at the election level (deactivated by default) then the votes will be proportional to their weight when calculating all the algorithms. for example, if the weight is 2, then the vote will count double.
This is an alternative and complementary to adding multiple votes. Using this mode of operation can save you (for large elections) a high cost in RAM or the configuration / development of a DataHandler, which can be complex. However, if you need to keep the information of each elector at Condorcet level, this functionality will not satisfy you, it is useful if at this level the voting information is useless or if it makes no sense.
- Using a DataHandler to externalize vote data is now compatible with vote tags.

### Internal changes
- More mature and tested management of external DataHandler. Your custom drivers need to be updated.
- News tests
- Minors clean-up, changes & optimisations

## [v1.4.1] - 2017-12-21
### Changed
- Add some aliases for Ranked Pairs

## [v1.4.0] - 2017-12-11
### Description
Rewrite and extend old and experimental implementation with a new one. After a lot of reading and some exchanges with Nicolaus Tideman.

### Added
- Ranked Pairs method is no more experimental thanks to a completely new implementation. It has also been divided into two methods :  "Ranked Pairs Margin" which is favoured by Nicolaus Tideman and Ranked Pairs Winning which is the variant most often mentioned in other documentation, including the English Wikipedia.  
Regarding compatibility with the old version,"Ranked Pairs" or "RankedPairs" calls now use Ranked Pairs Margin. Note that the old implementation, although failing in other respects, used a Winning version. which in some very specific cases can change your results.  
*[More information on Condorcet Wiki](https://github.com/julien-boudry/Condorcet/wiki/I-%23-Installation---Basic-Configuration-%23-2.-Condorcet-Methods)* 

- New method: [Election::getVotesListAsString](https://github.com/julien-boudry/Condorcet/blob/master/Documentation/Election%20Class/public%20Election--getVotesListAsString.md)  
- New method: [Result::Election::getResultAsString](https://github.com/julien-boudry/Condorcet/blob/master/Documentation/Result%20Class/public%20Result--getResultAsString.md)  

### Internal changes
- News tests
- Minors clean-up, changes & optimisations

## [v1.3.4] - 2017-11-29
### Fixed
- Potentially backward incompatible change if you use  the rare and useless Dodgson method**
  Fix #19 (thanks to @janmotl) : Our implementation of Dodgson was wrong. Or rather: used Tideman's approximation without knowing it. This could potentially lead to false results in some cases on this method.   
  Dodgson's original will not be implemented because of the work it would represent and strong performance limitations (number of candidates, number of votes).   

  Instead, we kept "Tideman approximation" but renamed it. And we added another approximation: "Dodgson Quick". We recommend this second solution, being the best of both, even if the two may be right in different cases or wrong together.
  More explanations here: https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/cmj_ftp/CMJ/September%202010/3%20Articles/6%2009-229%20Ratliff/Dodgson_CMJ_Final.pdf

  No longer any method use the call "Dodgson", please look at the [documentation](https://github.com/julien-boudry/Condorcet/wiki/I-%23-Installation---Basic-Configuration-%23-2.-Condorcet-Methods) to know which calls to use for either one.

## [v1.3.3] - 2017-10-04
### Fixed
- Critical bugfix : Result cache was frozen after serialize/unserialize an Election object. You can register or remove votes, but each result eventually computed before serializing stay frozen and potentially false.
If you not store Election object by serializing it, you are not affected.

## [v1.3.2] - 2017-09-24
### Fixed
- Minor bugfix release. Fix PHP errors on very small elections (Ranked Pairs / Minimax).

## [v1.3.1] - 2017-09-18
### Fixed
- Bugfix : Vote::getSimpleVote()
- Vote::getContextualVote() is renamed Vote::getContextualRanking()

## [v1.3.0] - 2017-09-17
### Description
Optional management of a new mode: if a vote does not specify the last rank. Then there is no last rank. This can significantly change the outcome of an election.
Previously (and still by default), if the last rank was not specified, it was automatically deducted.
This functionality is managed at the level of an election, it is possible to switch from one to the other without affecting the votes. The latter may even participate simultaneously in several elections using different modes.

Also add Dodgson method.

### Added
- Adds [Dodgson method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodgson%27s_method)
- Previously, if within a ranking, you do not specify all candidates participating in an election. It was considered that you placed the missing ones implicitly on a last rank.
This is always the default behaviour. Alternative behaviour is now added so that the missing candidates are ignored when calculating the results, which can significantly change the results. Please refer to the documentation.
- Add Kemeny-Young 'bestScore' information on Result::getStats()

### Changed
- If you vote using Candidate object. They will no longer be converted into another Candidate object with the same name if this one exist into the target election. They will be two different candidates... with the same name. It's more strict and prevent error in this strange case. 
However, it can strongly advised to not to mix different candidates with the same name, so that you do not mislead yourself! However, Condorcet now manages this case correctly.
If you vote by string or Json input : Nothing changes. Either a new candidate will be created or they will be converted with the candidate object with the same name in the first election of the voting object in which they will participate.
- Improved Condorcet::format()

### Fixed
- Fix Result::getWinner && Result::getLoser()
* Vote:getContextualVote() return stricter rank array key, from 1 to n.

### Internals changes
- Adds [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) with many tests in particular to monitor the results.
- Refactoring Copeland and Minimax code. With the new Dodgson method, they now all using the same lightweight code based on the improved PairwiseStats class.
- Many code refactoring.

## [v1.2.3] - 2017-09-03
### Changed
- The method Candidate::getName no longer takes an argument.

### Fixed
- More strict array key on Vote::getContextualVote method
- Various bugfix
- First PHP Unit tests

## [v1.2.2] - 2017-08-31
### Fixed
- Bugfix & Support for PHP 7.2
- Bugfix for KemenyYoung conflict detection API

## [v1.2.1] - 2017-07-28
### Fixed
- Bugfix Version ( thanks @hboomsma : https://github.com/julien-boudry/Condorcet/issues/15 )

## [v1.2.0] - 2016-12-11
### Changed
- Use the news PHP 7.1 syntax. PHP 7.1 is now require for 1.2.x branch and above.

## [v1.1.0] - 2016-09-11
### Added
- New Result class. The results are no longer provided as array, but as an result object. Coming with many methods (get it as an array, checkmetadata, get others results infos at the generation time...). It's implement Iterator / Countable / ArrayAccess for an excellent backward compatibility.
- Kemeny-Young paradox is now run more cleanly thanks to the new result object.

## Changed
- Using PHP new syntax and optimization. PHP 7.0 >= is now required for 1.1 branch.
- Improve multi-elections contexts. Now works in a manner consistent with what you want to do (and what yet allowed to imply the documentation).
- Efforts on documentation (wiki), and wide rewriting examples.
- Many internals refactoring and bugfix.


## [v1.0.0] - 2016-06-05
### Added
- **Experimental support for very large election**, it comes with critical internal changes. A functional driver for PDO is provided to be used with relational SQL databases, you will probably need to extend it or configure it (database structure...).      <br>
  The modular structure allows you to develop your own implementation to get outsourced datastore, for example we can imagine a NoSQL database driver.     <br>
  Benchmark shows that on PHP 7 + SQLite, 200 000 votes can be registered and computed in less than 60 seconds on a little server, with ~60mb RAM use. However, the speed of the driver does not change much the performance. From a certain point: slowdowns are intrinsically linked to internal processing side Condorcet engine. Major optimizations for speed can easily be done for further releases, but this would require a trade-off between speed and code complexity.     <br>
  _If you are interested by this feature, please have a look to the documentation. Consider that the functionality come in BETA stage._    
- New method Vote::getSimpleRanking -> Provide vote ranking as a string in one line. (Ex: 'A>B=D>C')
- New CondorcetPHP\Algo\Tools\VirtualVote:: removeCandidates(Condorcet/Vote $vote, array $candidateToRemove) static method clone your vote and return this clone without specified candidates.   

### Changed
- Requirement: PHP 5.6 is the new minimal PHP version. Full official support for PHP7 is now provided (and include some bug fixes).
- Internal Change: Many Cleans & Improvements

## [v0.97.0] - 2015-09-05
### Changed
- Internal change, for future management ability of billions of votes.
- Timer manager knows give an historic with CondorcetPHP\Timer\Manager->getHistory();

## [v0.96.0] - 2015-08-22
### Changed
- Condorcet autoloader move on Condorcet/__CondorcetAutoload.php folder, outside lib folder. If you don't have your own PSR-4 autoloader, you must now explicitly include this file, 
- Because of dramatically random performance beyond 7 Candidates, our flawed implementation of RankedPair method is now by default limited to 7 Candiates.
  More than ever, the implementation of RankedPair should be considered experimental; it's really the only method giving me serious problems.
- Some minor internal changes.

## [v0.95.1] - 2015-08-15
### Fixed
- Bugfix version

## [v0.95.0] - 2015-08-15
### Changed
The new class Election replace Condorcet class and retains most of its methods, static or not.
The class Condorcet survives. And now takes care of core configuration, such as recording modules.     

So you must now create an object Election instead of Condorcet. What is more explicit. The remaining methods related to class Condorcet are in the documentation and examples.
As the class keeps the Condorcet high static method (although specialized), code modification on your part will be very minor and generally involve changing the "new Condorcet" instruction to "new Election".

- Condorcet::getClassVersion is renamed Condorcet::getVersion

## [v0.94.0] - 2015-08-14
### Added
- Method name now have alias.
  So _Condorcet::getResult('Schulze')_ is now strictly equivalent to _Condorcet::getResult('Schulze Winning')_ or _Condorcet::getResult('Schulze_Winning')_ or the class namespace CondorcetPHP::getResult('CondorcetPHP\Algo\Methods\SchulzeWinning').

### Changed
- Condorcet:addAlgos is renamed to Condorcet::addMethod, it's more logic. Argument is now a fully-qualified class name. This class can now be outside of \Condocet namespace. Adding your own algorithm is now much cleaner.
- Condorcet::getPairwise(false) now return the new pairwise object instead of an abstract array. Condorcet::getPairwise(true) is unchanged and equivalent to Pairwise::getExplicitPairwise.  
  The new pairwise object implement \Iterastor and \ArrayAccess interfaces, so change may be transparent for you.
- PSR-0 autoloader support is removed. Instead, Condorcet is compliant with any PSR-4 autoloader, and it is now the only way to use it with Composer.
  If you don't have PSR-4 autoloader or you don't want to use Composer, you can continue to just include lib\Condorcet.php, its use now his own fallback PSR-4 implementation instead of his old PSR-0 implementation.
  Be careful, path to Condorcet.php change cause of PSR-4. It's now lib/Condorcet.php and not the old lib/Condorcet/Condorcet.php old path.

# Internal changes
- Reorganization about namespacing.
- Methods are now loaded by the normal and common autoloader.
- Pairwise is now an independent object, distinct from Condorcet object.
- Timer functionality now work outside of Condorcet class. With Timer\Manager and Timer\Chrono class. More improvement coming later (full log for benchmarking). You can get the timer manager by Condorcet::getTimerManager, but then know what you do!
- And other little things and optimization (deleting code deduplication, new constants instead of harcoding...).

## [v0.93.0] - 2015-08-02
### Changed
- Minor internals optimizations.   
- Some coding conventions change (can affect many lines). 

### Fixed   
- If you try to get Kemeny-Young 9 candidates on a Stable branch, Kemeny-Young will not try to store generic cache data on disk. This usage (although not recommended in all cases) is slower than before. but does not attempt to do something that should not be possible.

## [v0.92.0] - 2015-07-26
### Changed
- Deleting concept of Condorcet object default algorithm, and Class force algorithm. Now, there is only a Class Default method.
  _Now the default method is managed as static. It is no longer possible to force a method. Any management of the default object-level method is deleted
  This results in a simple boost, and therefore easier to understand documentation without gadgets methods.
  A slight speed increase can also be observed, the code being rid of a complex management resulting in many internal calls._
- Support PSR-4 autoloading with composer.
- New implementation of PSR-0 autloader. _(Automatically used if you do not go through one provided by Composer or framework or other valid autoloader. It acts only fallback of last resort)_.
- Some internal code cleanup (organizational change with sub-namespace, moving or rename some methods or class, better Schulze Family strategy).

## [v0.91.0] - 2015-03-28
### Changed
- Condorcet now use more usual PSR-0 class loading philosophy. And each Class and Interface has now her own PHP file according to PSR-0 specifications.
  - As result, the new architecture from Condorcet 0.90 is now fully compatible with framework (composer autoloader), is case of you would to play with Candidate Class (for example) before creating first an election by Condorcet Class. It's was a serious issue from Condorcet 0.90.
  - You can too continue to include /lib/Condorcet/Condorcet.php file as loader, if there is no others compatible autoloader, Condorcet will now use a new and special PSR-0 like autoloader for himself.
- Documentation files now use filename compatible with Windows filesystem (thanks Bill ^^)
- Minor and unnecessary coding style change.

## [v0.90.0] - 2015-02-14
### Description
New internal architecture. very important code refactoring, often completely rewritten. Relatively new API.

### Added
- Algorithms are now more isolated than Condorcet  activities, they use them by their own API.

#### Vote & Candidate are now objects!
- Candidate and Vote are now objects. You can continue to provide string, but all will be converted into object and the return values of most methods will favor this new philosophy.
- Vote and candidate are independent objects. They can participate in various elections simultaneously. They have their own lives and historical (name change, change of vote, elections to which they are taking or no longer taking part ...).
  They can be cloned, serialized, analyzed...
- Like Candidate object, a Vote object can take part into multiple elections. He can change its ranking and it will automatically affect all its elections. You can also provide top ranking, and its election can have other candidates. Condorcet will intelligently reconstruct a context for each election even if they do not have the same list of candidates!
- Off course, you can extend them !

#### Kemeny-Young improvements
- Code review.
- New Permutation class. 9 maximum candidates instead of 6! So, for performance reasons, I suggest to stay at 8.  
  Thanks to Jorge Gomes (@cyberkurumin) for his helpful commit!

#### Documentation

Documentation more consistent with the new size of the library has been established. It is not perfect yet, but the documentation work continues day after day to make up for the delay.

However, foundations and most contents are available now.
- New examples of codes meeting the latest revolutions.
- A new manual, in the form of a Wiki Github.
- Complete specifications for each of the public methods. Into the _doc_ directory.

### Changed
- **Condorcet::format** static method is a substitute to var_dump to print easily better human readable Condorcet data (Vote, RÃ©sult). It can also be used to return (and not print) more simple dataset.
- Many new methods or API change. But structure stay similar, and old simple scripts can continue to work without modifications or really minor changes.

## [v0.14.0] - 2014-08-10
### Description
The code will be very severely rewritten and restructured for the next major release.

### Added
- Added UNIX timestamp of the record of each vote time as a special tag.
- Ability to perform cryptographic checksum (SHA-2 256) the status of an election (candidates, votes, cache, library version).
- New static method setMaxVoteNumber, allow you to limit the number of votes in a election. And public method to ignore it (or not) for each object.
- Improvements and bugfixes around object serialization.
- New Options for getClassVersion method

### Changed
- Compatibility is now guaranteed from PHP 5.5.12 to PHP 5.6.x. But the vital methods seem functional with PHP (>=) 5.4.3
- Algorithm Kemeny-Young V2: more than 1000 times faster with a cache of pre-computed data. 6 candidates on an election is now very fast, and it is the new provisional limit.  
  Next Condorcet version will allow more candidates for Kemeny-Young (7 or 8), with more pre-computed sets.
- Customized limitation of maximum candidate for Kemeny-Young is removed.
- Works around the presentation of the single primary tag of each vote

### Fixed
- Improvements and bugfixes around object serialization.
- Many bugfixes and minor internal adjustments. Mostly to satisfy the development of condorcet-vote.org, which uses the library as a real framework of election management.
