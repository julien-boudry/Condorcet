    Set a new ranking for this vote.    

    Note that if your vote is already linked to one ore more elections, your ranking must be compliant with all of them, else an exception is throw. For do this, you need to use only valid Candidate object, you can't register a new ranking from string if your vote is already linked to an election.

    ranking:

      text: |
        * Ranking can be add by string like "A > B = C > D" (by candidate string name)

           ```
        * Or combine the 2 last ways.

    Unlike other methods to recover the result. This is frozen as soon as the original creation of the Result object is created.
    Candidate objects are therefore protected from any change of candidateName, since the candidate objects are converted into a string when the results are promulgated.

    This control method can therefore be useful if you undertake suspicious operations on candidate objects after the results have been promulgated.
