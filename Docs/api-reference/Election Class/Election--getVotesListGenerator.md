> [Read it at the source](https://github.com/julien-boudry/Condorcet/blob/master/src/ElectionProcess/VotesProcess.php#L145)

## Description    

```php
public Election->getVotesListGenerator ( [array|string|null $tags = null , bool $with = true] ): Generator
```

Same as Election::getVotesList. But returns a PHP generator object.
Useful if you work on very large elections with an external DataHandler, because it will not use large amounts of memory.
    

### **tags:** *`array|string|null`*   
Tags list as a string separated by commas or array.    


### **with:** *`bool`*   
Get votes with these tags or without.    


## Return value   

*(`Generator`)* Populated by each Vote object.
